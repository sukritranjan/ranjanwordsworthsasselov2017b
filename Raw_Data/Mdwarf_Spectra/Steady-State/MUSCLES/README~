M-dwarf spectra from MUSCLES Treasury survey, downloaded from: https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/muscles/. Data are described in detail in France et al. (2016, ApJ) and Loyd et al (2016, ApJ).

Data downloaded are the "*adapt-const-res-sed.fits = Panchromatic SED binned to a constant 1 Å resolution, downsampled in low signal-to-noise regions to avoid negative fluxes. One file per star."






Python example usage: 
from astropy.io import fits
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
spec = fits.getdata('hlsp_muscles_multi_multi_gj436_broadband_v10_adapt-const-res-sed.fits',1)
plt.plot(spec['WAVELENGTH'],spec['FLUX'])
plt.xlabel('Wavelength (Angstroms)')
plt.ylabel('Flux Density (erg/cm-2/s-1/A-1)')
plt.show()
