KEy outstanding questions: have the IUE data used here undergone the Massa & Fitzpatrick correction? Are geocoronal emission and instrument backgrounds a problem for this dataset as they were for GJ644, where France et al (2016) found up to 80% of UV fluence in some bands to be from non-instrumental sources?
