Unless otherwise stated, all data are from the The MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest.

In some cases, we also have cross-section compendiums from Edward Schwieterman at the University of Washington, that we used to check ourselves. If drawing on this work, credit is due to E.
